# Red Wine Quality Analysis 🍷

This is a data analysis project that explores the factors affecting the quality of red wine.
The goal is to help wine producers improve wine quality by understanding which physicochemical features influence the final product.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Records:** 1,599  
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical properties + 1 quality score

## 📂 Data Files
- **winequality-red-original dataset-uncleaned.csv - Original (raw) dataset**
- **winequality-red-cleaned.csv – Cleaned dataset with values rounded to 4 decimal places**

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn (for model building)  
- PowerPoint (for presentation)  

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and explored the wine dataset
- Rounded float values (e.g., chlorides, density) to 4 decimal places for clarity
- Converted quality scores into binary classification (low/high)  
- Visualized relationships between features and wine quality  
- Provided business recommendations based on insights  

---

## 📈 Future Work
- Try multi-class classification  
- Compare different machine learning models  
- Add more features to improve model accuracy
