# Red Wine Quality Analysis 🍷

This project analyzes factors influencing the quality of red wines and builds a predictive model to classify wines as "High Quality" or "Low Quality".

The goal is to help wine producers improve wine quality by understanding which physicochemical features influence the final product.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Total Records (Cleaned):** 1,359 (after removing 240 duplicate rows)
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical properties + 1 quality score
- **Target:** Binary quality label (0 = Low Quality, 1 = High Quality)

---

### Recent Changes (Aug 2025)
- Removed **240 duplicate rows** (from 1,599 → 1,359 rows)
- Rounded `chlorides` and `density` columns to **4 decimal places** for consistency
- Saved cleaned dataset as `winequality-red-cleaned Rows 1359.csv` and used it for all analysis
- Verified Low/High quality counts in Python and Power BI to ensure matching results

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and explored the wine dataset
- Removed 240 duplicate rows, reducing dataset from 1,599 to 1,359 unique wine samples to ensure accurate analysis and modeling
- Rounded float values (e.g., chlorides, density) to 4 decimal places for clarity
- Converted quality scores into binary classification (low/high)  
- Visualized relationships between features and wine quality  
- Provided business recommendations based on insights
