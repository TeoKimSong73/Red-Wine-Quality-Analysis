📄 Dataset Info – Red Wine Quality Dataset

🔗 Dataset Source:
UCI Machine Learning Repository – Red Wine Quality Data Set

📦 Dataset Description:
This dataset contains 1,599 observations of red wine samples from the north of Portugal.  
Each row represents a wine sample with various physicochemical test results and a quality score assigned by human tasters (score range: 0–10).

🧪 Features (Columns):

1. fixed acidity – Tartaric acid (g/dm³)
2. volatile acidity – Acetic acid (g/dm³)
3. citric acid – Citric acid (g/dm³)
4. residual sugar – Sugar after fermentation (g/dm³)
5. chlorides – Salt content (sodium chloride) (g/dm³)
6. free sulfur dioxide – SO₂ not bound to other molecules (mg/dm³)
7. total sulfur dioxide – Total SO₂ (mg/dm³)
8. density – Density of wine (g/cm³)
9. pH – Acidity level
10. sulphates – Sulfates (SO₄²⁻) content (g/dm³)
11. alcohol – Alcohol content (% vol.)
12. quality – Quality score (0–10) rated by experts
13. quality_binary – **(Added during project)**  
   - 0 = Low quality (score ≤ 5)  
   - 1 = High quality (score ≥ 6)  

📂 File Provided:
- `winequality-red-cleaned.csv` — cleaned version of the dataset with values rounded to 4 decimal places and added binary quality column.

🧹 Cleaning Summary:
- Verified no missing values
- Ensured correct data types (all numeric)
- Rounded float values for presentation clarity
- Created `quality_binary` column for binary classification modeling
