📄 Dataset Info – Red Wine Quality Dataset

🔗 Dataset Source:
UCI Machine Learning Repository – Red Wine Quality Data Set
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

📦 Dataset Description:
This dataset originally contains 1,599 observations of red wine samples from the north of Portugal.
After removing duplicate rows, the cleaned dataset used contains 1,359 unique samples.
Each row represents a wine sample with various physicochemical test results and a quality score assigned by human tasters (score range: 0–10).

🧪 Features (Columns):

fixed acidity – Tartaric acid (g/dm³)

volatile acidity – Acetic acid (g/dm³)

citric acid – Citric acid (g/dm³)

residual sugar – Sugar after fermentation (g/dm³)

chlorides – Salt content (sodium chloride) (g/dm³)

free sulfur dioxide – SO₂ not bound to other molecules (mg/dm³)

total sulfur dioxide – Total SO₂ (mg/dm³)

density – Density of wine (g/cm³)

pH – Acidity level

sulphates – Sulfates (SO₄²⁻) content (g/dm³)

alcohol – Alcohol content (% vol.)

quality – Quality score (0–10) rated by experts

quality_binary – (Added during project)
  - 0 = Low quality (score ≤ 5)
  - 1 = High quality (score ≥ 6)

📂 File Provided:

winequality-red-cleaned Rows 1359.csv — cleaned version of the dataset after duplicate removal, with values rounded to 4 decimal places and added binary quality column.

🧹 Cleaning Summary:

Removed duplicate rows (reducing dataset from 1,599 to 1,359 samples)

Verified no missing values

Ensured correct data types (all numeric)

Rounded float values for presentation clarity

Created quality_binary column for binary classification modeling
